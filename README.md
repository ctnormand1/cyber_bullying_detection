# Project 5 - Cyber Bullying Detection!
### Problem Statement
Many content providers on the internet give users the ability to write comments
with the goal of promoting healthy discussion. Unfortunately, comment sections
are prone to abuse, and many users experience cyberbullying in the form of
toxic, aggressive, or attack-laden comments. Programmatic detection of
cyberbullying has a strong use case for content providers who seek to remove
harmful content from their comment sections.  In this project, we address this
problem by developing a set of models to predict the likelihood that a comment
contains a personal attack, toxic language, or aggressive tone.
